# Bobby's Viro Starter Kit (For reproducing issues)

This is a blank React Native project setup with Viro. I will keep this up to date with issues from the Viro starter kit found [here](https://github.com/ViroCommunity/starter-kit)

> _⚠️ I have no plans of creating a PR from this project to the Viro starter kit._ This project is solely used for reproducing issues, and is not intended to be a demonstration of how to use Viro.

## Prerequisites

I have the [viro](https://github.com/ViroCommunity/viro), [virocore](https://github.com/) and this starter kit in the same directory. This package uses the viro main branch rather than the NPM version.

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/NS-BOBBY-C/starter-kit.git`
2. `cd starter-kit`
3. `npm install`
4. `npx pod-install` (iOS)
5. `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`

NOTE: The variant arguments are not needed for debug or release.

## How to Install Viro in an existing project?

If you are integrating ViroReact into an existing project, have a look at our [Installation instructions](https://github.com/ViroCommunity/viro/blob/main/readmes/INSTALL.md). Please note that this does _not_ work with Expo Managed Workflows. Sorry!
